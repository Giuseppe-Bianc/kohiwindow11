# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously and appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing any vulnerabilities you may find. To report a security vulnerability, please contact our security team by sending an email to bainconig6@gmail.com. We will make every effort to respond to your report in a timely manner.

Please provide us with the following details when reporting a vulnerability:

- A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Any additional information that could help us understand and address the issue effectively.

## Security Expectations

While we strive to ensure the security of our systems, we also expect responsible disclosure from security researchers. To maintain the safety and privacy of our users, we kindly request that you adhere to the following guidelines:

- Do not disclose or exploit any vulnerabilities to the public or other parties until we have had sufficient time to address the issue.
- Avoid unauthorized access to user data or any other sensitive information.
- Do not perform any actions that may negatively impact the availability or performance of our services.

## Bug Bounty Program

We appreciate the efforts of security researchers in improving the security of our systems. To show our gratitude, we offer a bug bounty program for valid security vulnerabilities. The program's details, including eligible vulnerabilities, rewards, and disclosure guidelines, can be found at [our bug bounty page](https://example.com/bug-bounty).

## Legal Implications

We value the security research community and understand that responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities is vital. We commit to not pursue legal action against individuals who discover and report security vulnerabilities according to this policy. However, we expect that you act in good faith and comply with the guidelines mentioned above.

Please note that this policy applies only to security vulnerabilities in our systems. For general support or non-security-related inquiries, please refer to our [support page](https://example.com/support).

## Updates to this Policy

We may update this security policy from time to time to reflect changes in our security practices or legal requirements. Any modifications will be posted on this page, and the revised date will be indicated at the top.
